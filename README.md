## Setup Guide (Archived from IsmaelTech's server-test)
First, go to the top of the repo and click on code > codespaces > create codespace
now you have your own free server instance to host eaglercraft. Next you need to run the setup commands:

create 2 terminal tabs and paste in the following snipits:

first tab: cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar

second tab: cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar

Now go to the ports area and forward (and make public) ports 25565 and 8081
Your eaglercraft server is setup!
